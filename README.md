"# Drone_Control_via_FMG
Files:
#Showtime.py: Contains the main script for controlling the quadcopter through FMG signals from the HeadBand.
#Drone_Control.py: Contains the prototype code for controlling the drone before integrating the HeadBand.
#multiplesensorsLiveData_4_SaveToCSV.py: Contains the main code for recording and plotting live FMG data from the HeadBand.
#MetricsKNN.py: Contains the script for training, saving the KNN algorithm, and printing its metrics..

Requirements:
The HeadBand module is required for the scripts to run.
The process only requires running Showtime.py with the trained algorithm saved as knn_model.pkl.
